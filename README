# Install
Start by installing the tools you'll need
`npm install`

## Serving for local
You'll need to serve the files using ```serve```. ```cd``` into the project direction and run ```serve```.

You can now visit the site at http://localhost:5000

## Editing Site Content (Templates)
Content for the site is generated using a handlebars template for the project pages (```src/templates/project-page.handlebars```).

To edit the site content edit the ```projects.json``` found under ```src/projects.json```.

Once you have made your changes to ```projects.json``` you need to compile your changes (see below).

## Compiling changes
The template files (above) require compiling before they are available using ```serve```.

Compile your changes using ```npm run compile``` when in the project folder.
